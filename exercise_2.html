		* Exercise Two
		* Why does the following output true?
		*///because they both have the same value. All objects are true so therefore it will evaluate to true. 

		var a = "false";
		var b = true;

		// "&&" is "and"
		console.log (a && b);

		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		*///because false reverses the logical statment which then makes it false.
