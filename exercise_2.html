		* Why does the following output true?
		*///because a truthie value. They are both truthies so it is true. 

		var a = "false";
		var b = true;

		// "&&" is "and"
		console.log (a && b);

		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		*///because if there is no falsie value then we return the first truthie value which in this case = false. ÃŸ
